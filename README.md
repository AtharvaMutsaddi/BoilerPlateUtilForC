# BoilerPlateUtilForC
A boiler plate util which enables u to create or open a program (like vim on windows as well). Please NOTE: this program opens the program in VisualStudio as of this Update and only works for C, C++ files as of now. 
To use this: just write the name of the program you want to open/create with a space between the program name and the file type (.c/.cpp)

EXAMPLE:
./boilerplate.exe hello .c
(generates a file with a C boilerplate or opens any pre-existing file called hello.c)
./boilerplate.exe hello .cpp 
(generates a file with a C++ boilerplate or opens any pre-existing file called hello.cpp)
PLEASE NOTE: The space between hello and .c is important
